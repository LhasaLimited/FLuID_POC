    "We use the hERG endpoint to validate the concept in the context of a classification task. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The sources of knowledge to federate are simulated by clustering a set of curated ChEMBL data into subspaces representing different chemical domains\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a k-mean algortihm and FCFP2 as the domain representation, we split the ChEMBL data into k different clusters, each cluster representing a virtual member of the federation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, we train k teachers models from the associated cluster data. Thiese teacher models represent private models that can be trained within the private space of each federation member.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We then annotate a large collection (100k) of unlabelled public data  using these teachers (one label/teachers) leading to a matrix of k labels for each structure. The collection of unlabbeled data is call the transfer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We consolidate the k labels into a single federated label using an a weighted average scheme over the classe probabilityies across the k labels. This step results in a new dataset of 100k structures annotated with a federated label; this label can be seen as a surrogate for an experimental label.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next we build a student model using the annotated transfer data as a training set\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to validate the approach, we compare the performance of the teachers models with the student model. More specififically we will use the Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) as the accuracy metric and compare the average teacher performance woth the student performance when validated against an external test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the student is performing better than the average teacher performance we consider the concept as validated\n",

    "## Building the student training data\n",
    "We now have a full set of non sensitive transfer data annotate by a federation of k teachers. We could use all this data to build a student model or we can ask ourselves if it is preferable to select a subset of data that would allow us to reduce the cost of building the student model and potentially to improve the performance of the student by selecting only the *best* data. We can therefore define what is a good data point and on that basis explore the performance of the student as the number of selected point increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting the student data points\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assertiveness ('best') \n",
    "The most intuitive criteria for selecting student training data from the annotated transfer data is the assertiveness of the label associated to the data. The label is the result of the consolidation of the individual labels provided by the individual teacher. The probability distribution of the class is a good indicator of the assertiveness resulting from the ensemble of teacher. If the probability of the most likely class is close to 1.0 (100%) than the all the teachers agreed and were themselves assertive and we could think that this is worth contributing to the training of our student. On the other hand if this probability is close to 0.5 (50%), either the teacher were in disagreement or they were not assertive or both and the data point does not seem to be valuable. We will therfore in a first instance select the data points with the highest probabvility of the most likely class. The inconvenient with this selection mode is that the most confident labels are not distributed evenly accross the FLuID space and this creates a weaker coverage of the chemical space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Max diversity ('random', 'balanced') \n",
    "Another criteria can be to maximize the coverage of the chemical space. Since the FLuID space is diverse and homogeneous we can simply pick randomly points in this space ('random'). The inconvenient of this selection method is that the decidability level of the points is arbitrary and the class may be not balanced. The latter is taken into account by taking the same number of instances from each classes ('balanced')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assertive and diverse ('mixed')\n",
    "If we want to combine assertiveness with diversity we can select randomnly a batch of points and subsequently cluster theses points in separate chemical spaces, then we can select from each cluster a subset of the most assertive points. We repeat this operation until we have collected the desired number of FLuID points. This approach select assertive and diverse points from the FLuID space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non assertivess ('worst')\n",
    "In order to have a base line we introduce a selection method that select the least assertive data points in the FLuID space. This will combine the weakenesses of 'best' and 'random' and shall provide a good base line to improve."
